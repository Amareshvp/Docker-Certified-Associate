## README: Copy-on-Write (COW) in Docker

Copy-on-Write (COW) is a resource management strategy used by Docker to optimize the way it handles storage for containers. This strategy allows Docker to save storage space and minimize overhead by sharing common data between containers whenever possible.

### How it works

When a container is created, Docker uses a layered file system to store the container's data. Each layer corresponds to an instruction in the Dockerfile, such as adding a file or running a command. These layers are read-only and shared between containers that use the same base image.

With the Copy-on-Write strategy, when a container needs to modify a file from its base image, Docker does not make changes to the original shared layer. Instead, it creates a new writable layer on top of the existing layers and makes a copy of the file in this new layer. The container then modifies the copied file in the writable layer, leaving the original shared layer unchanged.

### Benefits

The Copy-on-Write strategy provides several benefits:

- **Storage efficiency**: Since containers share the read-only layers, it reduces the storage space required for multiple containers using the same base image.
- **Faster container startup**: Containers only need to create a writable layer on top of the shared layers, making the startup process faster.
- **Resource isolation**: Containers can modify their own writable layer without affecting other containers, ensuring resource isolation and data consistency.

### Conclusion

The Copy-on-Write strategy in Docker optimizes storage usage, improves container startup time, and maintains resource isolation by sharing common data between containers and only creating copies of modified files when needed. This approach allows for better utilization of resources and a more efficient deployment of containers.
