Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a content trust and uploading a signed image to Docker Hub using the key name varun-dct and login name varunmanik:

Enable Docker Content Trust:


```

export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

Generate a delegation key pair (private and public key) for the varun-dct key:


```

docker trust key generate varun-dct
```

Log in to Docker Hub with your varunmanik account:


```

docker login 
```

Pull the image you want to sign and push to Docker Hub (for example, let's use httpd):


```

docker pull httpd:latest
```

Tag the image with your Docker Hub account and a custom tag:


```

docker tag httpd:latest varunmanik/httpd:signed
```

Add the delegation key to your Docker Hub repository:


```

docker trust signer add --key=varun-dct.pub varun-dct varunmanik/httpd
```


Sign the image using the varun-dct key and push it to Docker Hub:


```

docker trust sign varunmanik/httpd:signed
docker push varunmanik/httpd:signed
```

Verify that the image is signed and uploaded to Docker Hub:


docker trust inspect --pretty varunmanik/httpd:signed
This guide demonstrates how to create a content trust, sign a Docker image, and upload it to Docker Hub using a custom signing key. Now, when someone pulls the varunmanik/httpd:signed image, they can be confident that it has been signed and verified.
